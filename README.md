I have developed this assignment in Jupyter Notebook. The programming language I have used is Python. In this we have some built-in datatypes like List, Dictionary, Tuple and Set and there corresponding methods are used. We also have problems like finding the unique words within a sentence, usage of tab escape sequence and converting the weights in lbs. to kilograms. Additionally we have some problems for calculating the area of circle, circumference of circle and KNN classifier(K-Nearest Neighbors).
